# ForkLauncher for Nova

ForkLauncher is an extension for the [Nova IDE](https://nova.app) by [Panic Inc.](https://panic.com). This extension opens the current Nova workspace with the [Fork](https://www.git-fork.com) Git client. If the current workspace is not initialized with a git repository, Fork will offer to initialize it as one.

This extension is not written or endorsed by [the Fork publishers](https://www.git-fork.com/).

This extension is a fork of John Fieber's great [Tower extension](https://extensions.panic.com/extensions/org.ursamaris.nova/org.ursamaris.nova.tower/). I simply adapted the code to work with the Fork client. He deserves all the credit.
